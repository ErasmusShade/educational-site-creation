# Tests: This workflow assumes your CI passes. Add "statusChecks" if you want to wait for specific checks to pass.
# Security: Auto-merging from forks is risky. Keep allowForks: false unless you're handling validations elsewhere.
# Bot Access: GITHUB_TOKEN has limited access; for advanced workflows (e.g., repo in orgs), use a fine-grained PAT.
